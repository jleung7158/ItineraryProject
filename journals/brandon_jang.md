# Brandon's Journal for Itinerary Planner

## June 29th, 2023

- README.md set up
- Front end set up with Vite + React
- Wireframe templating

I spent today setting up our wireframe for the project with James. We have a solid direction in terms
of what we want to accomplish within a certain time crunch.
I set up the frontend for our project. We decided to set it up using Vite + React for the beneficial build times.

### Tomorrow's Plan

- Finish wireframing, and begin working on FastAPI endpoints
