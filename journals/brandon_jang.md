# Brandon's Journal for Itinerary Planner

## June 29th, 2023

- README.md set up
- Front end set up with Vite + React
- Wireframe templating

I spent today setting up our wireframe for the project with James. We have a solid direction in terms
of what we want to accomplish within a certain time crunch.
I set up the frontend for our project. We decided to set it up using Vite + React for the beneficial build times.

### Tomorrow's Plan

- Finish wireframing, and begin working on FastAPI endpoints

## July 5th, 2023

- Dockerfile created
- Docker containers set up
- FastAPI endpoints created

Today, I spent a majority of the time recapping the wireframe and going over exactly which endpoints needed to be created.
After that was done, I managed to complete the endpoints for the day.

### Tomorrow's Plan

- Check to make sure plans endpoints works with locations endpoint
- If working, start on frontend for the project
